<title>Using DICOM data with Slicer</title>



Slicer now supports reading DICOM (digital imaging and communications in medicine) Version 3.0 CT and MRI images.
(The SPL gratefully acknowledges Attila Tanacs for the work he did to add this
powerful capability to Slicer.) <br>
Currently, segmented and otherwise modified
DICOM images are written in the same format as other images that Slicer reads.
(For example, the images are written in big-endian format and numbered <code>imagename.001</code> to
<code>imagename.xxx</code>.)
<p>To read DICOM files with Slicer:</p>
<ol>
<li>
On the <b>Main</b> menu, click <b>Data</b>.</li>
<li>Click <b>Add Volume</b>. The <b>Props</b> panel appears.
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/dicom-load.jpg" ></p></center></li>

<li>
Click <b>DICOM</b>. (Not all the letters of DICOM may be visible.)</li>

<li>
Click <b>Select Dicom Volume</b>. (A file browser window appears.
This browser does not sort the file names alphabetically.
If there are many files in a directory,
it may be easier to type the path to the images than to use the browser.)

<center>
<p><img SRC="images/dicom_browser.gif" ></p></center>
</li>
<li>
Select an image and click <b>OK</b>.
A window appears, displaying patient information, studies, series, and files.
(If there are many images in the directory, it may take a while for the information to appear.)
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/dicom_if.gif" ></p></center>

</li>
<li>In this window, options include:
    <ul>
    <li>Select or deselect images to load. Selected images are
    shown in green and deselected images are shown in red. </li>
    <li>Click <b>Increasing</b> or <b>Decreasing</b> to load images in
    increasing or decreasing order.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Preview</b> to display images as small icon-size images in the bottom panel.
    You can change the size of the previewed images. The default
    size is 32x32 pixels.</li>
    <li>Click <b>List Headers</b> to display header information about the
    geometry of each image in the series.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Check</b> to display information about the volume and how
    to group the data. With DICOM data, the organization of the data is
    not always apparent. <b>Check</b> examines the slice location and thickness of each image
    in the volume to make sure all slices are the same distance apart.
    This helps to show when slices are missing.
    This is also useful when several DICOM acquisitions are lumped together.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>
After the data is organized properly, click <b>OK</b>.</li>
<li>Click <b>Extract Header</b>.
This
displays the information extracted from the headers describing the
dataset.
</li>
</ol>
