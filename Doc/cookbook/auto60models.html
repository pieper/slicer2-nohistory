<title>Creating 3D Models with Slicer</title>


One of the most important uses of Slicer is to create three dimensional reconstructions
of anatomical structures, using two dimensional slices as input.
This type of reconstruction is called a 3D model.
The input to this process is label map data that has been
created with Slicer's editing tools.

<br>To create a 3D model:
<ol>
<li>From the <b>Main</b> menu, click <b>ModelMaker</b>. The <b>ModelMaker</b> panel appears.</li>
<li>Click the <b>Create</b> tab. The <b>Create</b> panel appears.</li>
<center>
<img SRC="images/create_model_if.gif" ></center>
<li>Select the <b>Volume</b>.</li>
<li>Click <b>Label</b> and select a color, or enter a <b>Label</b> color number.
This is the value that will be used to create the model.
This should correspond to the value in the label map.</li>
<li>Enter a <b>Name</b> for this model.
</li>
<li>Enter a <b>Smooth</b> value, which controls how smooth the resulting model will be.</li>
<li>Enter a <b>Decimate</b> value, which indicates how redundant polygons will be reduced.</li>
<li>Click <b>Create</b> to start the model creation process.</li>
</ol>

Here is an example.
Below is a skull image segmented using the <b>Threshold</b> effect.
All voxels labeled 4 (blue) will be included in the resulting model.
