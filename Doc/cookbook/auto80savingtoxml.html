<title>Saving the scene description to an XML file</title>


In the <b>File</b> menu, there are several save options:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Save Scene</b><br>
This command will save the current session with a default name <code>data.xml</code>.
 If the user has previously specified a name, it will save the file as <code>name.xml</code>.</li>
<li>
<b>Save Scene As</b><br>
Allows the user to specify a name for the <code>.xml</code> file.
Once the user has specified a name,
use <b>Save Scene</b> for subsequent saves.</li>
<li> <b>Save Current Options</b><br>
Allows the user to save a file titled <code>Options.xml</code> that contains the options selected
during the current Slicer session (for example, the FOV, window settings, and so forth).</li>
<li> <b>Save Scene with Options</b><br>
Allows the user to save the scene (see <b>Save Scene</b> or <b>Save Scene As</b> above) and the options associated with the current Slicer session.</li>
</ul>
<p>
How to use these save options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch Slicer from the directory where you would like to save the label maps, <code>.xml</code> files, and models.</li>
<li>Load the data that you want to segment, and select values for viewing, such as FOV.</li>
<li>Use <b>Save Scene As</b> to save an <code>.xml</code> file with a specific name.</li>
<li>Use <b>Save Scene with Options</b> to save the scene with your selected options.</li>
<li>Begin segmentation. Save the label maps.</li>
<li>Use <b>Save Scene with Options</b> to save the scene.</li>
<li>Any time that you change and save the label maps, use <b>Save Scene with Options</b> to save the scene.</li>
</ol>
