<title>Add a Module</title>

<td valign=top>

For versions of Slicer starting with 2.0, new modules that are not
part of the main Slicer code base are added to the directory
<b>slicer2/Modules</b>. Instructions for building a custom module can
be found in <b>Modules/README.modules</b>, and sample code can be
found in <b>slicer2/Modules/vtkCustomModule</b>.
<br>
To ensure that the tcl files associated with the module are loaded
during the GUI construction, follow the instructions in the README.txt
file in the vtkCustomModule directory. If the renaming is done via the
call to the vtkNameModule tcl script, your module will be registered
with the Slicer base and will be initialized correctly. You
<b>must</b> name your subdirectory in the Modules directory starting
with the prefix vtk or it will not be automatically found at run time
nor during auto compilation via the cmaker.tcl script.

<p>
New core modules are added to the code base in the directory
<code>slicer2/Base/tcl/tcl-modules</code>.  Inside this directory, there is an
example file called <code>Custom.tcl</code> that explains in detail how to
create your own core module. This should be avoided unless you are adding new functionality necessary to Slicer.</p>

<p>
All files in the <code>tcl-modules</code> directory (generally referred to here as
"modules") will automatically receive a button on Slicer's main
menu.  They will also be provided with a tab on the GUI.
</p>

<p>
To allow multiple users to develop their own modules on UNIX systems,
Slicer will preferentially source modules in any local <code>Modules/vtk*</code>
directories that it finds in the directory from which it was run, your
home directory, or a user-designated Modules directory. Then
Slicer will continue on to source the rest of the core tcl files and
distributed Modules that it finds in the directory where it was
installed.

<small>

Run Slicer from inside your personal <code>slicer2</code> directory
and it will find your new modules.  This is because Slicer will
preferentially source Tcl files in your local <code>Modules</code> directory.<br>
If you have set your <code>HOME</code> environment variable, Slicer will load custom
modules from your <code>${HOME}/Modules</code> directory as well. You can also set
your <code>SLICER_MODULES</code> environment variable to point to more custom modules.
