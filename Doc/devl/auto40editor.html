<title>Adding Editor Effects</title>

This involves adding Tcl files to the Editor subdirectory of <code>tcl-modules</code>.
Look at the interaction between <code>tcl-modules/Editor.tcl</code> and one of the
Editor modules, such as <code>tcl-modules/Editor/EdDraw.tcl</code>.</p>
<p>
Also, a <code>vtkImageEditorEffects</code> VTK object (from the <code>vtksrc</code> directory) is
used to apply the pipeline for each effect.
