<title>Commenting Source Code</title>


<p>
The script <code>slicer2/Scripts/comment.tcl</code> will automatically place
comment headers above all procedures in all Tcl source code files.
Please run this script regularly, and then place descriptions of the procedures
in the comment headers.
(This script also places the copyright in all files, including those in the <code>Base/cxx</code> directory.)</p>

<p>
These comments are used to generate documentation for this website.
See the link <a href="../tcl/index.html">Tcl Source Code</a> in the Developer's Guide.
The comment headers can be written in pseudo-html.
See <code>slicer2/Base/tcl/tcl-main/Comment.tcl</code> for an example.</p>
