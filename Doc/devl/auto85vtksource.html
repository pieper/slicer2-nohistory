<title>C++ Source Code</title>

<p>
The Slicer project follows the coding style set out by KitWare for use with their VTK project. <a href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/contribute.php#coding-standards">Coding standards for VTK classes</a>.
<p>
The comments placed in the VTK source code according to the <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">doxygen</a> standard will be extracted from the VTK files and collected into a documentation page when the <code>document</code> script is run.
<p>
This will produce the <a href=../vtk/html/index.html>Base documentation page</a> as well as <a href="../vtk/Modules/index.html">Module documentation pages</a>.
