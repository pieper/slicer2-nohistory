1.) How to update the content at www.slicer.org
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The website is hosted on the web server at the Surgical Planning Lab.
Run this script: /projects/birn/slicer2/updateslicerweb

which does this (order matters):
cd /projects/birn/slicer2/slicerweb
cvs update -d
echo "Updating slicer2-web"
cd /projects/birn/slicer2/slicer2-web
cvs update -d
echo "Calling slicer2-web/Scripts/document.tcl"
cd Scripts
./document.tcl

The call to cvs update in /projects/birn/slicer2/slicerweb is to ensure 
that all needed directories have been created before the documentation 
is generated.

The SLICER_DOC environment variable is set to
/projects/birn/slicer2/slicerweb in the document script so that when
the document script is run, it will place the output html pages in the
directories that the web server displays to the rest of the world.

2.) How To Restart the web server:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
If there are problems with the pages being served, send an email to 
help@bwh.harvard.edu detailing the symptoms. 
The virtual hosting file is located here:
/projects/web/support/apache-common/conf/vhosts/slicer.conf
Namesdirect.com provides the redirection service, Steve Pieper at
pieper@bwh.harvard.edu holds the account password for slicer.org.
