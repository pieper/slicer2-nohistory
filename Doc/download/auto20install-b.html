<h3>Compatibility</h3>

Slicer has been tested on a variety of Windows versions and graphics
cards, but you may encounter problems depending on your system
configuration.  Slicer was compiled and most completely tested under
Windows 2000.
<a href='http://www.winzip.com'>WinZip</a> must be installed on your
computer before you begin the installation process.

<h4>System Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Memory</b>:  Minimum: 128 MB; recommended: 256 MB or greater.
<li><b>Disk Space</b>: 27.3 MB to download the installer, which expands to about 107.5 MB. The tutorial data set requires 37 MB.
<li><b>Processor Speed</b>: Has run successfully on a 333-MHz machine with Windows 98; a faster processor speed is recommended.
<li><b>Graphics Card</b>: Some older video cards and some laptops
restrict the amount of memory allocated to graphics functions and may
result in reduced image quality.
<li><b>Screen Resolution and Colors</b>: Minimum screen resolution: 1024 x 786; recommended: 1280 x 1024.
Minimum colors: 16 bit color; prefer: 32 bit color. (Note: 24 bit color works
on most machines, but may cause some rendering problems.)
</ul>


<h3>Installation Steps</h3>
<ol>

<li>
If you already have an older version of Slicer installed, uninstall
it.  (You can uninstall Slicer using the standard tools in the Windows
Control Panel. For example, with Windows 2000, from the <b>Start</b>
menu, select <b>Settings</b>, then <b>Control Panel</b>, then
<b>Add/Remove Programs</b>, and then select the version of Slicer to
uninstall. If this does not work, simply delete the Slicer program files.
There are no Registry entries to change.)

<br>&nbsp;<li>
Download the Windows version of Slicer onto your computer.
(Instructions about how to download the most recent version were emailed to
you upon receipt of your signed
<a href="http://www.slicer.org/cgi-bin/License/SlicerLicenseForm.pl">Software License Agreement</a>.
