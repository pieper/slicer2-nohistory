What does it mean that Slicer is for Research Use Only?
<p class=answer>
Slicer has been developed in an academic environment and is used as part
of controlled scientific experiments.  It is not a fully tested and
validated medical product and is not intended for general clinical use!

Slicer is made available in hopes of advancing the state of the art in
3D medical imaging.  Remember, as the Software License Agreement says,
we don't promise that it will work for anything; if you plan to use
Slicer, you are responsible for testing it to confirm that it will do
what you need.  Please be careful to follow accepted ethical principles
in all your research as well as institutional, local, state, national
laws ... and common sense.  Some documents that may be helpful are:
