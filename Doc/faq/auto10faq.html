<p class=question>
Which medical image file formats does Slicer read?</p>
<p class=answer>
Slicer reads both raw data (namely, binary files composed of shorts, unsigned
chars, and so forth) and DICOM (digital imaging and communications in medicine) formatted files.
<br>For raw data (regardless of whether the files have headers or not),
Slicer expects the images to be numbered as follows: I.001, I.002, I.003...
<br>If you have Genesis headers, try the automatic header-reading option.
<br>See the <a href='../tutorial/index.html'>Tutorial</a> for more information.
