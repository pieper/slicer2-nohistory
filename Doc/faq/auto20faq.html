How do I make a 3D surface model?
<p class=answer>
The first thing to do is to segment the 3D surface that you are
interested in.  Click <b>Editor</b>, then click <b>Effects</b>.  Your
choices for segmentation here are <b>Draw</b> or <b>Threshold</b>, and also
morphological operations (erode, dilate).  To Draw, for example, click
<b>Draw</b> and trace the structure in a slice, then click <b>Apply</b> and
proceed to the next slice.  To Threshold your structure instead, click
<b>Threshold</b>.

Once you have made a segmentation (its name in Slicer
will probably be "Working" unless you changed the default name), then click
<b>ModelMaker</b>.  Select the Working volume to make the model from, and
then click <b>Create</b> to make the model.

After a little while, your model will be created and visible in the 3D
window.  To save the model, click <b>ModelMaker</b>, then <b>Save</b>.
