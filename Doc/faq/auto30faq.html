<title>Making the Introduction Image</title>


<li class=faq>
<p class=question>
How did you make the image in the introduction to the website, with
the models and cutaway view into the brain?
<p class=answer>
To make models such as the skin and brain in the tutorial, you can use
two modules on the Slicer <b>Main</b> menu: <b>Editor</b> followed by <b>ModelMaker</b>.
Also, see the <a href='../users/index.html'>User's Guide</a>, under Segmentation.
<p class=answer>
To display the cut-through, you will need to use the Clipping
functions in Slicer.
<br>First, you can display the models and
grayscale slices that you are interested in.
<br>Then click the
<b>Display</b> tab on the <b>Models</b> panel, and right-click the model that you want
clipped.  This should be the skin model if you are using the tutorial
data from the ftp site, for example.
<br>A menu will appear.
Select <b>Clipping</b> to turn this on.  Now the model will be cut by
the grayscale slices.
<br>Next, click the <b>Clip</b> tab on the <b>Models</b> panel to adjust which
side of each grayscale slice should be used to clip the model.
<p class=answer>
Finally, to remove the black background in each of the grayscale
slices, you may use thresholding.
<br>On the <b>Display</b> tab of the <b>Volumes</b> panel,
there is a <b>Threshold</b> function.
<br>Click <b>Auto</b> and the black
background should disappear.  You may also manually adjust the
thresholding to get the desired effect.
