What about Linux?
<p class=answer>
Slicer works fine under Linux, and as of Slicer version 2 we are providing a
binary distribution for Red Hat Linux 7.3.
You can get a distribution at <a href="https://share.spl.harvard.edu/share/birn/public/software/">https://share.spl.harvard.edu/share/birn/public/software/</a>
<br>More information on building the source
code can be found <a href="../devl/index.html#5">in the Developers Guide</a>.
