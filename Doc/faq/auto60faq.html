<title>VTK or Tcl/Tk Already Installed</title>

<p class=question>
What if I already have VTK or Tcl/Tk installed on my PC?
<p class=answer>
This is unlikely unless you are a developer (if you don't know if
these are installed, they aren't).  <br>
If they are installed in
<code>WINDOWS/SYSTEM</code>, Slicer versions less than 2 will replace them. Later
versions come bundled with a <code>slicer2/Lib</code> directory that holds needed
VTK and Tcl libraries.
