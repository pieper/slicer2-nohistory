<title>General Compilation Errors</title>

<li class=faq>
<p class=question>
As I'm compiling Slicer, the compiler returns error messages for various
files.

<p class=answer>

This is probably because your source code is not in sync with the
latest version in CVS. For example, someone may be uploading new functionality and
may not be finished. Or, someone may have introduced errors into the package.
<br>Wait a day, and then download new source from the CVS archive
and try compiling again.
<br>Or, you can post a message to the <A href="mailto:slicer-devel@massmail.spl.harvard.edu">Slicer developer's list</A>. Include the
operating system and compiler versions that you are using, as well as a
copy of the compilation errors that you are seeing. You should receive an
answer soon.
