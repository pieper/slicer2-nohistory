<title>tcl/vtk*Tcl.cxx: syntax error before 'found'</title>

<li class=faq>
<p class=question>
As I'm compiling Slicer, the VTK files in the Tcl directory are
generating errors similar to this:<br>
<pre></pre>
<p class=code>tcl/vtkImageAccumulateDiscreteTcl.cxx:1: syntax
error before 'found'</p>

<p class=answer>

The automatic wrapper generator failed, since the parser wasn't able to
read the input file properly. This is most likely due to saving the files in
a different operating system format than the parser is running on. For
example, if the source was transferred from Windows, but was being compiled
under Linux.

Here's how VTK works with Tcl/Tk.
You can get shared libraries by compiling VTK.
However, Tcl/Tk is able to
use code from shared libraries only if they are in a specific format.
Unfortunately, VTK is not in this format.
That's why VTK has the ability to generate
another shared library, which will be the "bridge" between the two.
To do this, a special program parses all the VTK class headers and
generates a new C file (called, for example, <code>vtkImageAccumulateDiscreteTcl.cxx</code>).
The resulting C file will then be compiled.
This parser has some limitations, though: it can only accept a subset of legal C and C++ syntax.
If some error does occur, it will generate a C file containing only one line
and this will make the compiler stop.

If <code>vtkImageAccumulateDiscrete</code> is correct, you probably transferred the
source from Windows and the sources are in DOS text mode.  This is
usually not a problem for compilers, but it may confuse the
parser.

If this is the case, use the <a href="http://www.bastet.com/software/software.html"><code>dos2unix</code></a> utility to convert <code>vtkImageAccumulateDiscreteTcl.h</code>
in your local directory and compile again. This should give you an error
message also, but, hopefully, with the next file, you will see a valid
<code>vtkImageAccumulateDiscreteTcl.cxx</code> in your Tcl directory. Then you must convert
the rest of your files to UNIX mode and compile again.
