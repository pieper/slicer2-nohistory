<title>Can't find package <code>vtkSlicerBase</code> or Word Too Long</title>
<li class=faq>
<p class=question>
When I try to start Slicer on my UNIX system, I get an error: "can't find package vtkSlicerBase" or "Word too long".

The most common cause of this problem is that your environment
variable <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> has become too long for your shell.
<p>
This can be triggered when adding a lot of custom modules, as Slicer
is launched using the <code>csh</code> script (for versions between February 19,
2003 and March 2004, before we switched to <code>sh</code>), which silently
truncates environment variables if they are too long.<br>
You can edit the following line in <code>slicer2/launch.tcl</code> which originally
reads:<br>
<p class=code>set fp [open "| csh -c \"$env(VTK_DIR)/bin/vtk $mainscript $argv \" |& cat" r]</p>
<br>
to read:
<br><p class=code>
set fp [open "| /bin/sh -c \"$env(VTK_DIR)/bin/vtk $mainscript $argv \" |& cat" r]
</p>
<br>

This can also happen if you have commands in your <code>.cshrc</code> or <code>.tcshrc</code>
that append to <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, since these commands are executed
every time you open a new shell. If you spawn shells off from old
shells, the environment variable will keep growing as directories are
added again and again. Type "<code>echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>" and check the
output for multiple instances of directories. Also if you have a lot
of Modules in your version of Slicer, each one will add a directory to
your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> and you may run up against the system limit.
<br>Some
other solutions are:

<ol>
<li>Log out and log in again. This should reset your environment
variables for this session. Avoid starting Slicer from a shell that
has been spawned from another shell.</li>
<li>Move <code>set</code> or <code>setenv</code> or <code>export</code> commands dealing with your
<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> into your <code>.login</code> (<code>csh</code> or <code>tcsh</code>) or <code>.bash_login</code> file
(<code>bash</code>). This file is only executed once, when you log in, and this
method will avoid the concatenation problem. You will need to log out
and log back in for this to take effect.</li>
<li>Move your installed version of Slicer to a directory for which the
path is alpha-numerically shorter, thereby reducing the length of the
strings that will be added to your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
