<title>Couldn't execute "C:/Documents"</title>

<p class=question>
When I try to start Slicer on my Windows system, I get an error
similar to one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Error: couldn't execute "C:\Documents": invalid argument
<li>Error: couldn't execute "C:\Programs": invalid argument
</ul>

<p class=answer>
This is a problem with some older versions of Slicer. There are no
provisions in place to deal with spaces in the directory path leading
up to the <code>slicer2</code> directory.
<br>More recent versions have fixed this
problem for Windows by using the canonical short name of the
directories (namely, <code>C:\PROGRA~1</code>) to avoid the Tcl parsing problems
that occur with unexpected spaces in the directory path
strings.
<br>There is no current fix for UNIX pathnames
that include spaces, as this is something that generally causes
problems, and should be avoided.
<p>
To solve this problem, either move the <code>slicer2</code> directory to a new
location, such as <code>c:\slicer2</code> (with no spaces in the directory names
leading up to it), or obtain a newer version.
