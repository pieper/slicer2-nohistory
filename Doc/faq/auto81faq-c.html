<title>Error in startup script:</title>

<p class=question>
When I try to start Slicer on my unix system, I get an error
similar to the following:<br>
<code>Sourcing /home/user/slicer2/slicer_variables.tcl<br>
SLICER_HOME is /home/user/slicer2<br>
Error in startup script: The Tcl interpreter was probably not able to find
the VTK packages.  Please check that your TCLLIBPATH environment variable
includes the path to your VTK Tcl directory.  You might find it under your
VTK binary directory in Wrapping/Tcl, or under your site-specific
{CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/vtk/tcl directory.  The TCLLIBPATH current
value is:</code>

This is a problem due to an error in one of the support libraries that are required 
to run Slicer. Unfortunately, the error message isn't very helpful, so we have to turn
to some system tools to uncover the problem. <br>
First, make sure that the TCL/TK and VTK libraries built properly:
<ul>
<li>slicer2/Lib/[osname]/tcl-build/lib/libtcl[x.y].so and libtk[x.y].so
<li>slicer2/Lib/[osname]/VTK-build/bin/libvtk*.so and vtk
</ul>
If those files don't exist, go back to the slicer2/Scripts/genlib.tcl script and try 
rebuilding to determine why there was a failure.<br>
If the files are present, we need to make sure that they are linking in their 
support libraries properly. Start up Slicer with the Tk console via
this command (it is important to do this within the tkcon, as the
necessary paths are set up for Slicer in this environment): <br> 
<code>./slicer2-[osname] Base/tcl/tkcon.tcl</code><br>
In the terminal, type the following, and check for any empty paths in the output:<br>
<code>ldd Lib/[osname]/VTK-build/bin/vtk</code><br>
<code>ldd Base/builds/[osname]/bin/libvtkSlicerBase.so</code><br>
<p>
Typing <code>package require vtk</code> in the tkcon should succeed
and return a version number when the linkages are fixed. You can then
exit the tkcon and try restarting Slicer the regular way.
<!--
It is also possible that the compilation of the support libraries
finished, and all the secondary support libraries are found, but some
symbols may not be defined. You can run <code>nm</code> on the shared
object files and search for U = undefined symbols. This can also be
done from the Tk console: <br> 
<code>nm Lib/[osname]/VTK-build/bin/vtk</code><br>
<code>nm Base/builds/[osname]/bin/libvtkSlicerBase.so</code><br>
-->
