<title>Debugging Slicer</title>


<li class=faq>
<p class=question>
What are some things I can do to debug code in Slicer?
<p class=answer>
There are lots of tricks, as you've got access to all of tcl and all of
vtk as well as all of Slicer's code.
<p>
If Slicer is crashing after you change some cxx code, you can use a third party debugger. Under Unix, you can use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/documentation/">gdb</a> (GUI interfaces are provided by ddd and xgdb), and on Windows you can use <code>Microsoft Visual Studio Debugger</code>. It helps if Slicer has been compiled in Debug mode rather than Release (see flags in <code>slicer_variables.tcl</code>.
<p>
Under Unix, you need to launch Slicer and then get the process id of the vtk executable. Then, start <code>gdb</code> and issue the <code>attach</code> command with the process id as the argument. Then issue the <code>continue</code> command to allow Slicer to continue executing. Once a segmentation fault occurs in Slicer, go back to <code>gdb</code> and issue the backtrace command <code>bt</code> in order to see the stack of calls that led to the crash. 
<p>
Under Windows, start up Visual Studio and select <code>Attach to
Process</code> to link it into a currently running Slicer.
<p>
If Slicer is crashing during start up, you can start it manually using these steps from a terminal window:
<p class=code>
./slicer2-[osname] Base/tcl/tkcon.tcl
</p>
Attach the debugger, and then in the TK console:
<p class=code>
package require vtkSlicerBase<br>
source Base/tcl/Go.tcl
</p>
<p>
The TK console allows you to call tcl procedures and cxx methods, as well as some inspection methods.
<br>
You can declare variables, print the current value of the class members, and set and get values, and call methods:
<p class=code>
vtkThreshold mythresh<br>
mythresh Print<br>
mythresh AllScalarsOff<br>
mythresh GetAllScalars<br>
mythresh ThresholdBetween 128 200
</p>
You can find out all the methods for a class:
<p class=code>
mythresh ListMethods
</p>
<br>
You can turn on VTK level debugging (insert vtkDebugMacro calls in your code and recompile):
<p class=code>
mythresh DebugOn
</p>
You can find out all variables that have been declared to of a certain class:
<p class=code>
vtkThreshold ListInstances
</p>
You can list all the array elements for the Base and Module arrays:
<p class=code>
parray Slice
</p>

You can set variables:
<p class=code>
set Slice(2,visibility) 1
</p>

You can call tcl procs:
<p class=code>
Render3D
<p>

You can trace variables to find out when they're written, read, or unset: (<code>DevPrintTrace</code> added to Developer.tcl 5/26/06, use <code>echo</code> if it's not available)
<p class=code>
trace variable varname wru DevPrintTrace
</p>

You can explore TK window hierarchies using the winfo command:
<p class=code>
winfo children .tViewer
</p>

With newer versions of Slicer's tkcon (added to cvs May 12, 2006) you can autocomplete the methods for VTK classes using Shift-Tab.  
<p class=code>
(slicer2) 51 % vtkImageData id<br>
(slicer2) 51 % id Up&#9001;Shift-Tab&#9002;<br>
Update UpdateData UpdateInformation UpdateInformation<br>
(slicer2) 52 % id Update<br>
(slicer2) 52 % id UpdateD&#9001;Shift-Tab&#9002;<br>
(slicer2) 52 % id UpdateData<br>
</p>

Also added with the Shift-Tab is the Control-] command, to wrap the current command line in square brackets.  This short cut is helpful when building long command that use accessors to get to VTK class instances.
<p class=code>
(slicer2) 51 % myclass GetOutput&#9001;Control-]&#9002; <br>
(slicer2) 51 % [myclass GetOutput] 
</p>
