<a name="Introduction"><h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>The <b>3D Slicer</b> (or simply <b>Slicer</b>) software was initially developed as a joint effort between the <a href="http://spl.harvard.edu/" class="external text" title="http://spl.harvard.edu/" rel="nofollow">Surgical Planning Lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital</a> and at the <a href="http://csail.mit.edu/" class="external text" title="http://csail.mit.edu/" rel="nofollow">MIT AI Lab</a>. The program has evolved into a national plattform supported by a variety of federal funding sources. This versatile research environment has resulted in a wide array of functionality, supporting a variety of medical imaging projects. </p>

<p>Slicer is a "point and click" end-user application. Slicer is used as a vehicle for delivering algorithms to computer scientists, biomedical researchers and clinical investigators. Slicer is distributed under an open source license without a reciprocity requirement and without restrictions on use. For a sampling of the portfolio of applications, please see the <a href="http://slicer.spl.harvard.edu/pages/Slicer_Community" title="Slicer:Feedback"><b>Slicer Gallery</b></a> page. </p>

<a name="Acknowledgements"><h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>Slicer is expected to evolve dynamically in architecture and implementation by drawing on the expertise and effort of the wider <a href="http://www.na-mic.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.na-mic.org" rel="nofollow">NA-MIC</a>, NAC, <a href="http://www.nbirn.net">BIRN</a> and <a href="http://www.ncigt.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.ncigt.org" rel="nofollow">NCIGT</a>
communities. The NA-MIC software engineering methodology, as applied to the problems which Slicer has historically addressed, is expected to result in a cleaner architecture that is easier for developers to support and extend.
</p>

<p>Major funding for Slicer was provided through a variety of federal and private funding sources, including <a href="http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/">NCRR</a>, <a href="http://www.nibib.nih.gov/">NIBIB</a>, <a href="http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/">Roadmap</a>, <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/">NCI</a>, <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">NSF</a>, <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/">DOD</a> and others.
