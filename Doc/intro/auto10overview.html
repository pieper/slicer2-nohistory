Slicer uniquely integrates several facets of image-guided
medicine into a single environment. It provides capabilities for
automatic registration (aligning data sets), semi-automatic
segmentation (extracting structures such as vessels and tumors
from the data), generation of 3D surface models (for viewing the
segmented structures), 3D visualization, and quantitative
analysis (measuring distances, angles, surface areas, and volumes)
of various medical scans.

The image to the left was created by segmenting an anatomical MR
scan to form 3D surface models of the skin and tumor (green).
Functional MR data was segmented to build models of the
motor cortex (yellow), auditory verb generation (red), and
visual verb generation (blue).  All these surface models are
integrated in a 3D view along with 3 slices through the MR images.
The slices are also shown in 2D views at the bottom.  Note that
the functional data is overlaid in color on the anatomical data.

We integrated Slicer with an open MR scanner to augment
intra-operative imaging with a full array of
pre-operative data.  The same analysis previously reserved for
pre-operative data can now be applied to exploring the anatomical changes
as the surgery progresses.  Surgical instruments are tracked and used
to drive the location of reformatted slices.  Real-time scans are
visualized as slices in the same 3D view along with the pre-operative
slices and surface models. The system has been applied in over 20
neurosurgical cases at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and continues to
be routinely used for 1-2 cases per week.
