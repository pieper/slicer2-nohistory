<title>Basic Nodes</title>


We introduce the most important MRML nodes here, and more details can be found
under the <a href='#3c'>Current Details</a> section.

    <div class=q>Volume</div>
    <div class=a>
Volume nodes describe data sets that can be thought of as stacks of 2D
images that form a 3D volume.  Volume nodes describe where the images
are stored on disk, how to render the data (window and level), and how
to read the files.  This information is extracted from the image
headers (if they exist) of volume files at the time the MRML file is generated.
Consequently, MRML files isolate MRML browsers from understanding how
to read the myriad of file formats for medical data.

    <div class=q>Model</div>
    <div class=a>
Model nodes describe polygonal data.  They indicate where the model is
stored on disk, and how to render it (color, opacity, and so forth).  Models
(3D surfaces) are assumed to have been constructed with the orientation and voxel
dimensions of the original segmented volume.

    <div class=q>Matrix</div>
    <div class=a>
The output of a rigid-body registration is a rotation and translation
expressed mathematically as a transformation matrix.  These transforms
can be inserted into MRML files as Matrix nodes.  Each matrix
affects volumes and models that appear below it in the MRML file.
Multiple matrices can be concatenated together.

<td class=box1>
    <div class=q>Transform</div>
    <div class=a>
A Transform is not a node with attributes, but a construct for
building MRML files.  A Transform encapsulates the Matrix nodes inside it,
such that they are invisible to nodes outside the Transform.

<td class=box0>
    <div class=q>Color</div>
    <div class=a>
Color nodes define colors by describing not only the actual color
value, but also its name and a list of label values.  One attribute of
model nodes is the name of the associated color.  When Slicer displays
label maps, it colors each voxel by looking up the color associated
with that label value. Thus, when label maps appear on
reformatted slices, their colors automatically match the corresponding
surface models in the 3D view.

<td class=box1>
    <div class=q>Option</div>
    <div class=a>
Option nodes allow browser-specific information to be stored in
a MRML file.  For example, Slicer uses Option nodes to store
the user's 3D viewpoint information, since there currently is no
View node in MRML 2.0.
