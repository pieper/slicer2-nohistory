<small>So, you've heard that, with the Java programming language,
you can 'write once, run anywhere.' This means that when you compile your
program, you don't generate instructions for one specific platform. Instead,
you generate Java bytecodes, which are instructions for the Java Virtual
Machine (Java VM).</small>
