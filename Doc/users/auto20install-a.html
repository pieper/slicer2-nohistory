<h3>Solaris installation instructions</h3>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>
Slicer is compatible with Solaris 2.8 (also known as Solaris 8 or SunOS 5.8) and OpenGL 1.2.
Although we do not formally support Solaris 2.5, some users have been able to make it work with
some difficulty.

<h4>System Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Memory</b>:  Minimum: 128 MB.
<li><b>Disk Space</b>: 35 MB to download the installer, which expands to about 140 MB. The tutorial data set requires 37 MB.
<li><b>Processor Speed</b>: Has run successfully on a 450-MHz machine; a faster processor speed is recommended.
</ul>


<h3>Installation Steps</h3>

Replace <code>slicer</code> in the following instructions with the correct version, operating system designation, and date, 
for example, <code>slicer2.4-solaris-sparc-2005-01-11</code>.


<ol>
<li>
Download the desired version of the <code><b>slicer.tar.gz</b></code> file to your computer. 
(Instructions about how to download the most recent version were emailed to
you upon receipt of your signed 
<a href="http://www.slicer.org/cgi-bin/License/SlicerLicenseForm.pl">Software License Agreement</a>. 
If you have not filled this out yet,

<br>&nbsp;<li>
At a shell prompt, type the following commands to uncompress the file and create a 
<code>slicer2</code> directory:
<pre></pre>
<p class=code>gunzip slicer.tar.gz<br>
tar xf slicer.tar</p>

<br>&nbsp;<li>
The <code>slicer2/slicer_variables.tcl</code> file automatically sets up the <code>SLICER_HOME</code> environment variable
to point to the directory where the <code>slicer2</code> directory is installed.

<br>&nbsp;<li>
Move the <code>slicer2</code> directory into a shared system directory that every user can access. Create a symbolic link from a directory that is in every user's <code>PATH</code>
environment variable to <code>slicer2/slicer2-solaris-sparc</code>. For example, this may be <code>/usr/local/bin</code>.

<br>&nbsp;<li>
Launch Slicer by typing the following command at a shell prompt:
<pre></pre>
<p class=code>slicer2-solaris-sparc</p>
</ol>
