<h3>Windows Installation Instructions</a>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>

Slicer has been tested on a variety of Windows versions and graphics
cards, but you may encounter problems depending on your system
configuration.  Slicer was compiled and most completely tested under
Windows XP.
<a href='http://www.winzip.com'>WinZip</a> must be installed on your
computer before you begin the installation process.

<h4>System Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Memory</b>:  Minimum: 128 MB; recommended: 256 MB or greater.
<li><b>Disk Space</b>: 27.3 MB to download the installer, which expands to about 107.5 MB. The tutorial data set requires 37 MB.
<li><b>Processor Speed</b>: Has run successfully on a 333-MHz machine with Windows 98; a faster processor speed is recommended.
<li><b>Graphics Card</b>: Some older video cards and some laptops
restrict the amount of memory allocated to graphics functions and may
result in reduced image quality.
<li><b>Screen Resolution and Colors</b>: Minimum screen resolution: 1024 x 786; recommended: 1280 x 1024.
Minimum colors: 16 bit color; prefer: 32 bit color. (Note: 24 bit color works
on most machines, but may cause some rendering problems.)
</ul>
