<h3>SPL Installation Instructions</h3>

<p>Please run the current version, 2.4.1 built for the SPL from the 2.4 release code with the addition of the vtkAG module: <code>slicer24</code>. <br>
<code>slicer2</code> will run version 2.1b1.

<br><br>
Alternatively, you can download the source code for your operating system (see above),
and compile pointing to these libraries:
<br>
<code>/projects/birn/slicer2/lib/solaris8</code>
</p>

When a new release is ready for lab use, it will be installed in a subdirectory of <code>/projects/birn/slicer2</code> and a link will be created in <code>/spl/os/bin/</code>.

<!--This is the domain of the Slicer development team, please use the globally installed version,
accessible by typing <code>slicer</code>, <code>slicer-stable</code>, or <code>slicer-nightly</code>.
<br>
These instructions are in the process of being updated to mesh with the new
Solaris OS directory hierarchy and encap system.
-->
