<title>Loading Data</title>

<p>Slicer can load several different types of data, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>volumes (such as MR slices);</li>
<li>models (3D surfaces);</li>
<li>scenes (Slicer views of data).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Volumes</h3>

<p>A volume is a collection of volume elements (voxels) of an image.
A slice is a portion of a volume.</p>

<p>Slicer can read medical image volumes of various types&nbsp;(including GE
Signa and  Genesis data, DICOM (digital imaging and communications in medicine) slices, and non-header image data).
If Slicer does not recognize the header automatically,
you must enter the necessary information manually, so that Slicer can read the volume correctly. </p>

<h3>Models</h3>

<p>A model is a 3D surface.</p>

<p><b>Technical Note:</b> The data format for the models that Slicer reads
in is vtkPolyData. Model files have a suffix of <code>.vtk</code>.</p>

<h3>Scenes</h3>

<p>A scene is a description of a Slicer view, including path names to volumes and models, as well as viewing options.</p>

<p>Scenes are saved in an XML file. Scene files have a suffix of <code>.xml</code>.</p>
