<A NAME="a"></A><h3>Threshold effect</h3>
<p>The goal of thresholding is to limit the output image to only those pixels
whose signal intensity is between the lower and upper bounds you select.
In the new output volume, all the pixels will have a single label (the <b>Output</b> color).
<br><b>Threshold</b> is useful for separating the anatomy of interest
from surrounding anatomy, based on the signal intensity of the anatomy of interest. For example, <b>Threshold</b> works well for segmenting bone in CT data.
<br><br>To use <b>Threshold</b>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Threshold</b>. This panel appears:
<center>
<img SRC="images/editor_details_tab_threshold.jpg" ></center></li>
<li>Select the <b>Input Volume</b>.</li>
<li>Select the <b>Scope</b> and <b>Interact</b> ranges.</li>
<li>Click <b>Output</b> and select a color, or enter an <b>Output</b> color number. You can also enter an optional label for what that color will represent. For instance, in this example, the chosen color is 2 (orange) and the label is 'skin'.</li>
<li>Adjust the <b>Lo</b> slider to exclude points whose signal intensity is too low.</li>
<li>Adjust the <b>Hi</b> slider to exclude points whose signal intensity is too high.</li>
<li>Click <b>Apply</b> to apply the thresholding effect. Slicer will update the <code>Working</code> volume with your new label of thresholded data.</li>
</ol>

 <h4> Results of thresholding</h4>

<p>In the example below, we are segmenting the CT skull bone.
Thresholding has changed the label to be blue.
Notice that the skull is well-defined and separated from the rest of the image.

<br><br><br>
<A NAME="b"></A><h3>Erode effect</h3>
<p>The <b>Erode</b> effect removes pixels at the border of all islands. Slicer considers an island to be a group of connected pixels that have the same label. Dilation is the opposite effect, and adds pixels around the borders of all islands.
<br><b>Erode</b> is useful for separating two distinct pieces of anatomy that are only partially connected, or for removing many small islands,
some of which are connected to the anatomy of interest (as shown below).

<center>
<img SRC="images/erode1.gif" ></center>

<br><br>To use <b>Erode</b>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Erode</b>. This panel appears:
<center><img SRC="images/editor_details_tab_erode.jpg" ></center>
</li>
<li>Select the <b>Input Volume</b>.</li>
<li>Select the <b>Scope</b> range. <b>Multi Slice</b> applies the one-slice erosion to each slice.
<b>3D</b> treats the whole volume at once.
</li>
<li>Click <b>Value to Erode</b> and select a color, or enter a <b>Value to Erode</b> color number. <b>Erode</b> will act only on pixels with the selected <b>Value to Erode</b> color.</li>
<li>Enter 0 for the <b>Fill value</b>.</li>
<li>Enter the number of times to apply the effect in the <b>Iterations</b> field.</li>
<li>Select 4 for <b>Neighborhood Size</b> for less erosion or 8 for more erosion.</li>
<li>Select <b>Active</b> to apply <b>Erode</b> to the active view. Select <b>Native</b> to apply <b>Erode</b> to the original view.</li>
<li>Click either:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Erode</b> to remove pixels with the <b>Value to Erode</b> from around islands.</li>
    <li><b>Dilate</b> to add pixels with the <b>Value to Erode</b> around islands.</li>
    <li><b>Erode &amp; Dilate</b> to erode, then dilate.</li>
    <li><b>Dilate &amp; Erode</b> to dilate, then erode.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>

<br><br><br>
<A NAME="c"></A><h3>Change Label effect</h3>
<p>The <b>Change Label</b> effect changes the value of the label of pixels to another value.
<br><b>Change Label</b> is useful when you are merging two data sets together
and you want to keep the data sets distinct from each other.
<br><br>To use <b>Change Label</b>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Change Label</b>. This panel appears:
<center>
<img SRC="images/editor_details_tab_changelabel.jpg" ></center></li>
<li>Select the <b>Input Volume</b>.</li>
<li>Select the <b>Scope</b> range.</li>
<li>Enter a <b>Value to change</b>. This is the value of label of pixels in the <b>Input Volume</b> that Slicer will change.</li>
<li>Click <b>Output</b> and select a color, or enter an <b>Output</b> color number. This is the new value that pixels with the <b>Value to change</b> will receive.</li>
<li>Click <b>Apply</b> to apply the change label effect. Slicer will update the <code>Working</code> volume with your newly labeled data.</li>
</ol>



<br><br><br>
<A NAME="d"></A><h3>Draw effect</h3>

<p>The <b>Draw</b> effect lets you specify pixels by drawing directly on them using the mouse.
<br><b>Draw</b> is useful when automatic methods cannot segment the data correctly.

<br><br>To use <b>Draw</b>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Draw</b>. This panel appears:
<center>
<img SRC="images/editor_details_tab_draw.jpg">
</center>
</li>
<li>Click <b>Output</b> and select a color, or enter an <b>Output</b> color number. This is the new value that pixels you draw on will receive.</li>
<li>Enter a value for the <b>Point Radius</b>, which controls how fine each line of the drawing is. Using a value of 1 or 2 allows you to select individual points.</li>
<li>Select the <b>Mode</b> of the left mouse button in the draw window.
<b>Draw</b> is for drawing on points. <b>Select</b> is for selecting points. <b>Move</b> is for moving selected points.</li>
<li>If the <b>Mode</b> is <b>Select</b> or <b>Move</b>, you can use:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Select All</b> to select all points.</li>
    <li><b>Deselect All</b> to deselect all points.</li>
    <li><b>Delete Selected</b> to delete selected points.</li>
    <li><b>Delete All</b> to delete all points.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Select the <b>Render</b> range.</li>
<li>Select the <b>Shape</b> that the left mouse represents in the draw window.</li>
<li>Click on the region of interest, using the left mouse button, and Slicer will draw as specified with the <b>Mode</b>.
You can use the right mouse button to zoom in and out on the area.
The middle mouse button (or Alt-Left button) moves the image in the window.
        <p>Note: If you encircle too much of an image in
        a particular slice, use <b>Draw</b> with <b>Black</b> output to
        create polygons around the extraneous areas; this acts like an
        eraser. You may also delete the last selected point of your polygon by
        selecting <b>Delete Selected</b>.
        </p>
</li>
<li>To clear the list of points after you click <b>Apply</b>, click <b>Yes</b>. To keep the same points in a list after you click <b>Apply</b>, click <b>No</b>.</li>
<li>When you have finished drawing the outline of the region of interest, click <b>Apply</b>.
Slicer will fill the region of interest with the <b>Output</b> color.</li>
</ol>




<br><br><br>
<A NAME="e"></A><h3>Identify Islands effect</h3>

<p>The <b>Identify Islands</b> effect automatically assigns a unique label to each
"island" in the designated "sea", namely, the area containing the islands.

<br><b>Identify Islands</b> is useful when many separate islands have the same label, but belong to different structures.

<br><br>To use <b>Identify Islands</b>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Identify Islands</b>. This panel appears:
<center>
<img SRC="images/editor_details_tab_identifyislands.jpg" ></center></li>
<li>Select the <b>Input Volume</b>.</li>
<li>Select the <b>Scope</b> range.</li>
<li>Enter <b>Min Threshold</b> and <b>Max Threshold</b> values to identify islands in a certain intensity range.</li>
<li>Click any part of the "sea", namely, the area containing the islands. The islands within that area will receive a unique label.</li>
</ol>




<br><br><br>
<A NAME="f"></A><h3>Remove Islands effect</h3>
<p>        <b>Remove Islands</b> automatically removes areas based on size.<br>
        <b>Remove Islands</b> is useful for removing small areas
        that should not have been thresholded.<br>
        For example, if you use a value of "10",
        all islands less than 10 voxels in size will be removed.</p>




<br><br><br>
<A NAME="g"></A><h3>Change Island effect</h3>
<p>The <b>Change Island</b> effect changes the label of an "island" of pixels.
Slicer considers an island to be a group of connected pixels that have the same label.
<br><b>Change Island</b> is useful when, after applying an effect (particularly thresholding) to the volume, you still are not able to separate the anatomy you are interested in.
For example, surrounding areas may have the same signal intensity as the anatomy of interest, as in the case below: separating the skull is difficult because surrounding points have the same label as the skull itself.
<center>
<img SRC="images/change_island1.gif" ></center>

<br><br>To use <b>Change Island</b>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Change Island</b>. This panel appears:
<center>
<img SRC="images/editor_details_tab_changeisland.jpg" ></center></li>
<li>Select the <b>Input Volume</b>.</li>
<li>Select the <b>Scope</b> and <b>Render</b> ranges.</li>
<li>Click <b>New Label</b> and select a color, or enter a <b>New Label</b> color number. This is the new label value that pixels in the selected island will receive.</li>
<li>Click any part of the island. The pixels that are part of that island will receive the <b>New Label</b> value.</li>
</ol>

<br><br><br>
<A NAME="h"></A><h3>Save Island effect</h3>
<p><b>Save Island</b> will retain the selected island, and remove disconnected pixels with the same label.
<br><b>Save Island</b> is useful for separating a single connected structure from other structures.</p>



<br><br><br>
<A NAME="i"></A><h3>Measure Island effect</h3>

<p>The <b>Measure Island</b> effect calculates the volume of an island of pixels. Slicer considers an island to be a group of connected pixels that have the same label.

<br><br>To use <b>Measure Island</b>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Measure Island</b>. This panel appears:
<center>
<img SRC="images/editor_details_tab_measureisland.jpg" >
</center></li>
<li>Select the <b>Input Volume</b>.</li>
<li>Select the <b>Scope</b> range.</li>
<li>Click <b>Island Label</b> and select a color, or enter an <b>Island Label</b> color number. <b>Measure Island</b> will calculate the volume of the pixels with the <b>Island Label</b> color in the selected island.</li>
<li>Click any part of the island. Slicer will display the <b>Size</b>, in pixels, of the island you clicked. Slicer will also display the size of the <b>Largest</b> island within the selected <b>Scope</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To calculate the total volume of the selected island, the following formula is used:<br>
<code>size * pixel_size * pixel_size * (thickness + spacing)</code></p>




<br><br><br>
<A NAME="j"></A><h3>PhaseWire effect</h3>

<p><b>PhaseWire</b> is a semi-automatic effect to outline features on images by following edges or contours.
<br>Using <b>PhaseWire</b> is a rapid way to outline a feature.
<br>Warning: <b>PhaseWire</b> does not work in all versions of Slicer, and may cause Slicer to crash.

<br><br>To use <b>PhaseWire</b>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>PhaseWire</b>. This panel appears:
<center>
<img SRC="images/editor_details_tab_phasewire.jpg">
</center>
</li>
<li>Click <b>Basic</b>. (Only the <b>Basic</b> features work.)</li>
<li>Click <b>Output</b> and select a color, or enter an <b>Output</b> color number. This is the new value that pixels you outline will receive.</li>
<li>Select the <b>Render</b> range.</li>
<li>Select the <b>Shape</b> of the outline in the draw window. <b>Polygon</b> will close the shape that you outline by selecting points, when you click <b>Apply</b>. <b>Lines</b> will draw lines between points you select. <b>Points</b> will create points of color where you select.
</li>
<li>Select the <b>Image Feature Size</b>.</li>
<li>Click the left mouse on the edge of the feature that you want to outline.
Release the mouse button, but follow the edge with the mouse.
<br>If the "wire" starts to stray from the edge, click the mouse button to pull in the wire.</li>
<li>To undo the last mouse click, click <b>Undo Last Click</b>.</li>
<li>To start the outline process again, click <b>Clear Contour</b>.
</li>
<li>When you have finished drawing the outline of the region of interest, click <b>Apply</b>.
If <b>Polygon</b> is selected, Slicer will fill the region of interest with the <b>Output</b> color.
If <b>Lines</b> is selected, Slicer will outline the region of interest with the <b>Output</b> color.</li>
</ol>
