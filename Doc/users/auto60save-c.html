<title>Save Scene</title>



<p>You can save a description of the current scene.
This does not save any volumes, label maps, or models, but does save the path names
to those files in an XML file.
You can then open them all again later, just by opening the scene file.
<br>Note: Before saving the scene, you should save any new volumes, label maps, and models separately first.
<br>Note: The default directory to save files in is <code>SLICER_HOME</code>.
</p>

<p>To save a description of the current scene:</p>
      <ol>

        <li>Click <b>File</b>. A drop-down menu appears.
        <p><img src="images/file_submenu.jpg"></p>
        </li>

        <li>There are several ways to save the scene,
        depending on your preferences for file name and options.

        <ul>

        <li>To save the file with the default file name (<code>data.xml</code>) and path, and with no options,
        select <b>Save Scene</b>.</li>

        <li>To use another file name or path,
        select <b>Save Scene As</b> and enter your own file name. </li>

        <li>Use <b>Save Scene With Options</b> to include options in the scene description.
        Options include view mode, field of view (FOV), background color, and other preferences
        you set. Options are saved to file named <code>Options.xml</code>. </li>

        <li>To save only the current viewing options, without saving the scene itself,
        select <b>Save Current Options</b>.</li>

        </ul>

        </li>
        </ol>

        <p>To open a saved scene later:</p>
<ol>

<li>Click <b>File</b>.</li>

<li>Click <b>Open Scene</b>.</li>

<li>Find the scene file (usually <code>.xml</code> or <code>.mrml</code>), double-click it, and wait for the volumes and models to load.                </li>

</ol>
