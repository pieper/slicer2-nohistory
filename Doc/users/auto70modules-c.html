<title>Acquiring New Modules</title>


<h2>Acquiring New Modules</h2>
<p>Independently developed modules are often checked into the Slicer code archives, and are tested for possible distribution in future releases.
<br>Sometimes they are published on the Web sites of the groups that have developed them, or are announced on the Slicer users or developers mailing lists.
<br>A new module will have to be compiled to be compatible with your version of Slicer, so you must have a version of Slicer that includes source code and <code>.vtk</code> header files.
