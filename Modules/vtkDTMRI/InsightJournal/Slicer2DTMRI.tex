\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document describes our open source software for diffusion tensor
visualization and analysis.  The software is called DTMRI, after the
acronym DT-MRI, meaning diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging.
Its functionality includes tensor calculation from diffusion-weighted
images, tensor visualization using tractography and glyphs, and
measurement of scalar invariants such as anisotropy measures.  Other
features include clustering of tractography, selection of fibers based
on intersection with regions of interest, and conversion of fiber
trajectories to voxels for voxel-based analysis.  DTMRI is distributed
as a module in the 3D Slicer 2.0 open source medical image analysis
and visualization tool.

\end{abstract}

\tableofcontents

The goal of this paper is to give a high-level overview of the
functionality available in the DTMRI software.  We begin with a very
brief background section to familiarize the reader with the concept of
the diffusion tensor, then the remaining sections demonstrate the
capabilities of the software especially emphasizing the types of
images and 3D views that can be generated.  Finally we conclude with
instructions to obtain the software, acknowledgements, and additional
references of interest.


\section{Background on the Diffusion Tensor and Scalar Invariants}
Diffusion MRI measures the diffusion of water molecules in the brain.
The water molecules may diffuse faster in some directions than others,
depending on the cellular structure of the tissue \cite{beaulieu02,
pierpaoli96} . The diffusion tensor is a mathematical model
\cite{basserBIOPHYS94} used to describe the amount of diffusion in all
directions, and from this model the principal, or fastest, diffusion
direction can be estimated. In white matter regions where fibers do
not cross, the direction of fastest diffusion corresponds to the
orientation of the white matter fiber tract.

The diffusion tensor ${\bf D}$ is a $3 \times 3$ symmetric
positive-definite matrix that is proportional to the covariance matrix
of water molecule displacements during the imaging time.  Its major
eigenvector corresponds to the principal diffusion direction.  The
tensor has three eigenvalues ($\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \lambda_3
\geq 0$) that quantify the diffusivity of water in the principal
diffusion direction and in two perpendicular directions. From the
tensor, various scalar invariants can be calculated that describe the
``shape'' of the diffusion.  (The word ``scalar'' means a single
number, as opposed to a vector or tensor.  The word ``invariant''
refers to the fact that these numbers are invariant to rotation of the
brain in the MRI machine, i.e. they do not depend on the directions in
which diffusion was measured, though it is important to measure using
enough directions).  By ``shape'' of diffusion, we mean whether the
diffusion is approximately equal in all directions (spherical), in a
plane or pancake shape (planar), or mainly in one direction (linear).

For reference we include formulas for three common scalar invariants:
the trace, the fractional anisotropy (FA) \cite{basserJMR96}, and the
linear measure ($c_L$) \cite{westin02,westin97}.

\begin{equation}
  {\rm trace}({\bf D}) = \sum_{i=1}^{3}{\bf D}_{ii} = \sum_{i=1}^{3}\lambda_i
\end{equation}

Note that the mean diffusivity (MD) and the ADC refer to the average
rather than the sum of the eigenvalues, that is ${\rm trace}({\bf
D})/3$.

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:FA}
{\rm FA} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \frac{\sqrt{(\lambda_1-\hat\lambda)^2 +
     (\lambda_2-\hat\lambda)^2 + (\lambda_1-\hat\lambda)^2}}
     {\sqrt{\lambda_1^2 + \lambda_2^2 + \lambda_3^2}} =
     \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2}} \frac{{\rm norm}({\bf D} - \frac{1}{3}{\rm
     trace}({\bf D}){\bf I})}{{\rm norm}({\bf D})}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diffMeasuresWestin}
c_L = \frac{\lambda_1 - \lambda_2}{\lambda_1}
\end{equation}

\section{Diffusion Tensor Calculation}
The tensor is calculated as described in \cite{}.


\section{Diffusion Tensor Visualization}

\subsection{Glyphs}
A glyph is a 3D object which is oriented according to the tensor
eigenvector(s) and scaled by the tensor eigenvalue(s)
\cite{basserBIOPHYS94,kindlmann04}.  In addition, color can be used
with glyphs to indicate orientation or a scalar invariant of the
tensor.  Example images follow.

\itkcaption[Major Eigenvector Glyphs]{The direction of the major eigenvector of each tensor is indicated with a line.  The lines are colored by $c_L$.}
\label{fig:GlyphLineLinear}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Major Eigenvector Orientation as RGB Color}

In 3D Slicer, the coordinate system is RAS (right-anterior-superior)
and these directions are mapped to the red, green, and blue color
channels \cite{pajevic99} to produce images such as the following.


\section{Scalar Invariant Calculation}
The scalar invariants that can be calculated in DTMRI are listed in table \ref{table:Scalars}.

\section{Tractography}
Tractography is performed by sequentially stepping in the principal
diffusion direction \cite{basser00,conturo99,mori99,westin99}.  Our
tractography class inherits from vtkHyperStreamline.

The module has been developed by members of Carl-Fredrik Westin's
Laboratory for Mathematics in Imaging at Brigham and Women's Hospital,
Harvard Medical School.  Original module development (beginning in
2001) was performed by Lauren O'Donnell, then a graduate student at
MIT in the CSAIL and HST departments.  In 2003 (*****????)  Raul San
Jose Estepar became a primary maintainer and developer of the DTMRI module.
