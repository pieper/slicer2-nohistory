    This module implements a version of anisotropic diffusion published in 
    
    "Flux-Based Anisotropic Diffusion Applied to Enhancement of 3D Angiographiam"
    Karl Krissian
    IEEE Trans. Medical Imaging, 21(11), pp 1440-1442, nov 2002.
    
    It aims at restoring 2D and 3D images with the ability to preserve
    small and elongated structures.
    It comes with a Tcl/Tk interface for the '3D Slicer'.
