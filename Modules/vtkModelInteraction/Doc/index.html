    <h1>ModelInteraction Module Instructions</h1>

    <p>
      This module allows interactive selection of models in the slicer
      scene.  You can create "clipboards" which contain various
      models.  By using the mouse to select models in 3D, models can
      be added to and deleted from these clipboards.  Each clipboard
      can be named, and made visible/invisible.

    <h3> Model Selection </h3>

    <b> Select (S): </b> Click the 's' key on the keyboard to select the model
    under the mouse pointer.  This adds the model to the current
    clipboard. The selected model will become highlighted (red color).

    <p>
    <b> Delete (D): </b> Click the 'd' key on the keyboard to delete the model
    from the clipboard.  If highlighted, the model will become
    un-highlighted (not red).

    <p>
    <b> Highlight: </b> You can turn this on and off for the current group.

    <h3> Display </h3>
    By using the Show/Hide All button, you toggle between showing
    all models, showing only those not on a clipboard, and showing
    none.  By using this button you may easily identify those models
    which have not yet been placed on a clipboard.
    
    <p>
      Using the Show/Hide Group button allows you to make the current
      clipboard visible or invisible. 

    <h3> Saving </h3>
    To save clipboards, they can be exported to the MRML scene in
    the form of ModelGroups.  Each clipboard becomes a
    ModelGroup. Then by saving the scene under File->Save, the
    groups are saved as well.
    
    <p>
      When reading a MRML scene file that contains model groups, these
      can be imported to clipboards for further editing of the groups.

    <p>
      Currently, a model may only be in one ModelGroup. When exporting
      the clipboards you may get an error message in the tkcon window
      about models in more than one group.  Then the duplicated models
      will be shown highlighted in the Viewer window, and you must
      ensure they are in only one group before exporting to
      ModelGroups.
